title:  Why should I buy a textbook that costs $200?
---

<p>One of the biggest challenges facing college students across the United States is the exorbitant price of textbook and even rentals. For my Data Structures class our professor requests that we purchase a textbook to supplement his teacher that will run us somewhere in the range of $191 new and at best $80 used. Ofcourse, a student could rent the text book for $70. Financially speaking buying a used book for 80 and a rental for 70 makes absolutely no sense. However, as everyone acknowledges students will hardly ever use these textbooks after they have completed the course. Then why ask us to buy these textbooks in the first place? Are there absolutely no other books on the market for professors to suggest for us to buy? Hardly likely that this could ever be the actual case. </p>

<p>Researching the individual who has chosen to write this exorbitant text leads me to discover yet another professor who suffers from the "Publish or Perish" mentality. A mentality that leads professors to write an arduous amount of textbooks to supplement their own classes. Just as we express our outrage when our professors prescribe textbooks they themselves wrote I imagine students of other schools express the same outrage. Researching this professor has not led me to any conclusion that warrants the purchase of such an exorbitant textbook. Is not my professor a doctor of this field as the author is. Do I not pay to attend this school and receive instruction from nota ble professors. Apparently we are paying for teaching ability which is severely lacking</p>
