title:  Frustrated with Windows? Envious of Mac? 
---

<p>It never fails to amaze me the switch in technology we have begun to make. Gone are the days when Windows computers were the forefront for programming. I suppose with Apple taking the creative market and then the subsequent merger of hardcore developing and visual aesthetics there has been a shift towards Macs being the development machine of choice. I remember three years when I first entered St John's University all Computer Science students were advised to take the Windows running free laptop option as opposed to the Mac option especially considering we needed Visual Studio. Now anytime I try to dabble with a new programming language or technology all tutorials point me to the easy peasy Mac install with no simple windows solution in sight.</p>
<p>Even something as common place as Python has an easy Mac installer and Windows does not. Is this possibly because of previous issues with Mac that have forced many to have to find better Mac ports? Lets not even start talking about homebrew and other easy Mac solutions that Windows doesn't have. Should I even bother to touch on how much better Mac's terminal is as opposed to command prompt? No, I probably shouldn't. Did someone say wheres my XCode? Yup, seems like the doorway to better programming and a future in entrepreneurship lies in owning a Mac computer.</p>
